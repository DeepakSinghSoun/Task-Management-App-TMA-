# ✅ Task Management App (TMA)

📌 **Project Name:** TMA – Task Management App

🗓️ **Started On:** July 11, 2025

This is the beginning of my new project **Task Management App (TMA)**, built with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The goal is to create a simple yet powerful app to manage daily tasks with priority, status, and a clean UI.  
This project marks an important step in my **Full Stack Development journey** and helps me strengthen my skills in component design, state management, and responsive frontend UI.

Stay tuned as I continue building and improving it day by day! 💻🔥
